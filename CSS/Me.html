    <h1>Hey I'm Me.</h1>
    <p>I’m me — not by accident, not by design, but by a thousand tiny choices, moments, and thoughts stitched together.<br> I’m the quiet mornings I spend with my own mind, the loud laughter that bursts out at the wrong time, the doubts that keep me up, and the dreams that keep me going.
    <br>I’m me because I’ve stumbled, stood up, and sometimes sat down to catch my breath. I’m me because I’ve cared too much and sometimes too little.<br> I’m me because I’ve lived in the past, worried about the future, and tried, every day, to be present in the now.</p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Because being true to yourself brings inner peace.</li>
        <li>Because no one else can live your life or think your thoughts.</li>
        <li>Because authenticity builds real connections with others.</li>
        <li>Because you grow most when you embrace who you already are.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Why not?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Because sometimes who you are now might hold you back from who you could become.</li>
        <li>Because being “just me” can turn into an excuse to avoid change or effort.</li>
        <li>Because people might misunderstand or judge you for showing your real self.</li>
        <li>Because blindly clinging to “I’m me” could mean ignoring flaws that need work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m not perfect, not finished, and never final. And that’s the best part — I’m me, becoming.</p>
    <hr>

    
    <h1>You should you</h1>
    <p>You should be you — wildly, stubbornly, unapologetically.<br> You should be the person who laughs at odd things, who cries at small kindnesses, who loves what you love even if no one else understands why.
    <br>You should be the voice that disagrees when it matters, the heart that stays soft when the world says “harden.”<br> You should keep your quirks, your questions, your quiet moments of wonder — because those are yours alone.
    <br>You should be you, even when it feels easier to blend in, to shrink, to silence your spark.<br> Because someone, somewhere, needs to see that it’s okay to simply exist as yourself — incomplete, imperfect, but real.<br>You should be you — because there is no better person you could possibly be.</p>
    
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Because it’s freeing to live without pretending.</li>
        <li>Because your uniqueness might inspire someone else to do the same.</li>
        <li>Because life feels lighter when you’re not wearing a mask.</li>
        <li>Because only you can bring your full, authentic perspective into the world.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Why not?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Because sometimes adapting a little makes relationships and teamwork smoother.</li>
        <li>Because parts of who you are might still be harmful to yourself or others and need reflection.</li>
        <li>Because stubbornly insisting on “just being you” can close you off from growth.</li>
        <li>Because in certain moments, compromise or restraint might be wiser.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    <h1>We should be both</h1>
    <p>We should be both — you and me, separate yet side by side.<br>We should be the comfort in each other’s silence and the spark in each other’s laughter.
    <br>We should be strong when the other feels weak, gentle when the other feels raw. We should hold space for each other’s shadows and dance together in each other’s light.
    <br>We should be both — individuals with our own dreams and fears, yet also something more when we come together: a shared story, a quiet understanding, an unspoken promise.
    <br>We should keep our edges, keep our differences, but let them fit together like pieces of the same strange, beautiful puzzle.<br>Because being both means we don’t lose ourselves — we find each other.</p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Because together, we can share strengths and soften weaknesses.</li>
        <li>Because connection adds meaning that solitude alone can’t give.</li>
        <li>Because being both individuals and a “we” creates balance: freedom with belonging.</li>
        <li>Because love or friendship deepens when we respect each other’s individuality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why not?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Because merging too much can blur personal boundaries.</li>
        <li>Because relying on “we” might make it harder to stand alone when needed.</li>
        <li>Because conflict can arise if the “both” starts to feel unequal.</li>
        <li>Because sometimes individual paths demand space, even from those we love.</li>
    </ul>
